# kaggle_practices.

Hey there! Thank you for visiting.

This is a compilation of all my notebooks that I've created under kaggle.

This is a way for me to track my personal experience learning machine learning, please do feel free to learn from my mistakes! :)

Do note that for later notebooks, the hyperlinks do not work as they are designed to work on kaggle instead of github.
